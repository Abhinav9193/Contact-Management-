ðŸ“Œ Contact Management System
The Contact Management System is a full-stack web application designed to efficiently manage contacts. Built with Spring Boot for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, this project provides a seamless and user-friendly experience.

With this system, users can add, edit, delete, view, and search contacts effortlessly. The contacts remain hidden initially and are displayed only upon user interaction, enhancing the overall experience. The application features a visually stunning and interactive UI, ensuring an engaging look and feel.

The backend is powered by Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA, ensuring smooth data handling and database operations. Additionally, the RESTful APIs enable secure and efficient communication between the frontend and backend.

This project serves as a great example of full-stack development, integrating a responsive and dynamic frontend with a well-structured and scalable backend. ðŸš€
